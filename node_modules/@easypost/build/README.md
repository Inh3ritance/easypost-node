node-build
==========

Tools for generating webpack config to build easypost projects like @easypost/api.

* `npm install --save @easypost/node-build`


Support
-------

This package is meant to build @easypost packages only, and will not accept public issues unless
relating to packages under the @easypost NPM namespace.


Building
--------

* Add `"build": "ep-node-build"` to your npm scripts
* Add `"watch": "ep-node-build --watch"` to your npm scripts too
* Add `"lint": "ep-node-build lint"` to your npm scripts for maximum points. You can run it with
  `--fix` too.

Run `npm run build` or `npm run watch` respectively.


Customizing
-----------

This will automatically load and merge any `${CWD}/webpack.config.js` you happen to be using.
If you need further customization, create a `node-build.js` file, which exports a function that
takes webpack config and returns webpack config (see `./examples/node-build.js` for a template.)
